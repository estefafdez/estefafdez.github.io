    As Head of QA at Genially, I was responsible for defining and leading the overall QA strategy within the Technology department, focusing on both manual and automated testing to ensure the reliability, usability, and security of our interactive content platform.

I reported directly to the CTO, ensuring strategic alignment and visibility of quality initiatives at the leadership level. My responsibilities included designing and maintaining detailed test plans and cases, evaluating and optimising our automation stack—including Cypress Dashboard, CI/CD pipelines, reporting, and alerting tools—and promoting a strong culture of quality across the company. 

    I also established and monitored QA metrics to continuously improve testing processes and support Genially’s international growth.
